During the day there isn’t much going on, but after 5:00pm, Jalan Alor Food Street is one of the Kuala Lumpur best places to visit. An incredible number of hawker stalls dishing up local Malay and Chinese cuisine line the street, enticing passers-by with tantalizing scents and bargain meals. The street gets packed with visitors and the best stalls have crowds surrounding them. Some vendors offer food-on-the-go options, while others serve heaping platters to customers sitting on low stools at plastic tables in a hustle and bustle ambiance.",
